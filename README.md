# Bean
Here lies the documentation of my actions, both intentional and accidental, made solely to prevent future me from staring blankly into the chaos of my own incompetence... This is a work in progress... everything is probably broken.

## 1. Requirements
### 1.1 Physical components
Component | Purpose
--- | ---
[Raspberry Pi 5 (4 GB)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CK3L9WD3) | Computing
[Raspberry Pi active cooler](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0CLXZBR5P) | Cooling
[SanDisk 32 GB memory card](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B06XYHN68L) | Storage
[Pimoroni HyperPixel 4.0 Square Touch](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07V9K54WV) | Display
[Mini USB microphone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DCZ9M6RV) | Audio in
[Adafruit STEMMA speaker & audio amplifier](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B082MNXJG5) | Audio out
[Waveshare USB sound card (external audio converter)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08R38TXXL) | Audio out
(Not purchased yet) Momentary push-button |
(Not purchased yet) Power bank (Anker Nano Power Bank A1653 5000 mAh, 5V 3A PD out) |
[Adafruit female-female jumper wires (75mm)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B071YNFGBR) |
[USB AMale-AFemale extension cables](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09LYRRQ91) |
[JST PH2.0 connector cables](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B091FHPN1X) |

Test by powering on the Pi. Make sure that the matrix lights up, and that the mic and speaker play the ALSA test tone `speaker-test -t sine -f 440 -c1 -l1`.

### 1.2 Software and services
Service | Purpose
--- | ---
OpenAI API | Whisper for speech recognition, ChatGPT for conversation.
Google Chirp API | I might use this for speech recognition instead of Whisper, after determining which has lower latency.
ElevenLabs API | Speech generation.
Raspberry Pi Imager | Flashes the SD card.

## 2. The actual nitty gritty
### 2.1 Initial setup
1. Flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit, bookworm) with Pi Imager. In the advanced menu pre-set the Wifi SSID / password and enable SSH.
2. Boot and set further configs ONLY after the SD is ready. [Code](https://github.com/matchadolly/Bean/blob/24a24d0f58b4ea604729f6c7e5683276512e8c35/Initial%20setup%20configs).
3. Test to see whether the peripherals work. [Code](https://github.com/matchadolly/Bean/blob/e74847fb253be7dbcd22d8fc8ba5485866d700f9/Peripheral%20tests).
### 2.2 Planned project file structure
	Bean/
 		main.py
	 	settings.json  # ðŸŽ€ Can be edited by user.
	 	memory.txt  # ðŸŽ€ One fact per line.
	 	faces/  # ðŸŽ€ PNG frames for each mood. Could use MP4 or GIF instead?
	 		happy_0.png
			happy_1.png
	 	systemd/bean.service
Create the directories `mkdir -p ~/bean/{faces,systemd}`
### 2.3 Core loop (python skeleton)
NOT the full code, just the very basic logic. [Code](https://github.com/matchadolly/Bean/blob/dfc2127b9ef422b7bd7f65b778a547f716c1c584/main.py)
